This documentation is written in MDX, and hosted/produced with [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/). It was created using the [Mintlify Starter Kit](https://starter.mintlify.com/quickstart).

## Development

From the root of this repo, run:

```bash
npm run docs
```

View your local preview at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Publishing changes

Changes are deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch.

If you are working on _this_ repo, visit your [Mintlify Dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) to make changes to the publication strategy. <small>NB: the login details for the dashboard are <github+mintlify.com@dylankenneally.com> with a 'magic link'.</small>

If you have forked this repo, install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app) to propagate changes from your repo to your deployment.

## Troubleshooting

- If your dev environment isn't running: Run `mint update` to ensure you have the most recent version of the CLI.
- If a page loads as a 404: Make sure you are running in a folder with a valid `docs.json`.

## Known issues

The mintlify local development has a couple of known issues to be aware of; you will see the following differences when viewing the localhost version of the documentation vs. the deployed version:

1. The favicon for the site is only visible on the deployed site
1. The timestamp at the bottom of each page is only visible on the deployed site, i.e. `Last modified on March 6, 2026`

Relevant [docs.json](./docs.json) config sections

```json
  "favicon": "/favicon.ico",
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": true
  },
```
